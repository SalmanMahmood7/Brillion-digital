## ServiceDetailModal Component

### Location
`/components/ServiceDetailModal.tsx`

### Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- **Tabbed Interface**: Features, Benefits, and Case Study tabs
- **Authentication Integration**: Uses AuthButton for gated content
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and focus management
- **Theme Consistency**: Maintains orange (#f97316) color scheme

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface ServiceDetailModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  service: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    fullDescription: string;
    features: Feature[];
    benefits: Benefit[];
    caseStudy: CaseStudy;
    pricing: Pricing;
    timeline: string;
  };
}
```

## Implementation Pattern

### Step 1: Imports
```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import ServiceDetailModal from "@/components/ServiceDetailModal";
```

### Step 2: State Management
```tsx
const [selectedService, setSelectedService] = useState(null);
const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

const handleLearnMore = (serviceKey) => {
  setSelectedService(servicesData[serviceKey]);
  setShowModal(true);
};
```

### Step 3: Service Data Structure
```tsx
const servicesData = {
  serviceKey: {
    title: "Service Name",
    description: "Brief description",
    fullDescription: "Detailed description...",
    features: [
      {
        title: "Feature Name",
        description: "Feature description",
        icon: "IconName" // from lucide-react
      }
    ],
    benefits: [
      {
        title: "Benefit Name",
        description: "Benefit description", 
        metric: "Quantified metric"
      }
    ],
    caseStudy: {
      client: "Client Name",
      challenge: "Business challenge",
      solution: "Our solution approach",
      result: "Measurable outcomes"
    },
    pricing: {
      starting: "$X,000",
      description: "Pricing context"
    },
    timeline: "X-Y weeks/months"
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Button Integration
```tsx
<button 
  onClick={() => handleLearnMore('serviceKey')}
  className="existing-button-classes"
>
  Learn More
  <ArrowRight className="w-4 h-4 ml-2" />
</button>
```

### Step 5: Modal Component
```tsx
{selectedService && (
  <ServiceDetailModal
    isOpen={showModal}
    onClose={() => {
      setShowModal(false);
      setSelectedService(null);
    }}
    service={selectedService}
  />
)}
```

## Button Enhancement Patterns

### Standard Button Enhancement
```tsx
// Before
<button className="existing-classes">
  Get Started
</button>

// After  
<button 
  onClick={() => handleLearnMore('serviceKey')}
  className="existing-classes"
>
  Learn More
  <ArrowRight className="w-4 h-4 ml-2" />
</button>
```

### Service Card Enhancement
```tsx
// Before
<div className="service-card">
  <h3>Service Title</h3>
  <p>Service description</p>
  <button>Learn More</button>
</div>

// After
<div className="service-card">
  <h3>Service Title</h3>
  <p>Service description</p>
  <button onClick={() => handleLearnMore('serviceKey')}>
    Learn More
  </button>
</div>
```

## Theme Preservation Guidelines

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Orange**: `#f97316`
- **Hover States**: `#ea580c` 
- **Background**: `bg-orange-50` for light backgrounds
- **Text**: `text-orange-600` for accent text

### Button Styling
```tsx
className="text-[#f97316] font-semibold flex items-center group/btn"
// or
className="bg-[#f97316] hover:bg-[#ea580c] text-white"
```

### Consistent Patterns
- Maintain existing layout structures
- Preserve original spacing and typography
- Keep existing animation and transition styles
- Use existing component patterns where possible

## Quality Assurance Checklist

- [ ] Authentication integration works for gated content
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness functions properly

### Data Validation
- [ ] All service titles are accurate
- [ ] Pricing information is current and formatted consistently
- [ ] Case studies contain realistic scenarios and metrics
- [ ] Feature descriptions are clear and comprehensive
- [ ] Benefits include quantified metrics where possible

### Design Compliance
- [ ] Orange theme color (#f97316) used consistently
- [ ] Original page layouts preserved
- [ ] Button styling matches existing patterns
- [ ] Modal design aligns with site aesthetics
- [ ] Responsive behavior maintains design integrity

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Modal loading times are acceptable
- [ ] No memory leaks in state management
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Optimal bundle size impact
- [ ] Fast initial page load times

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Modal Not Opening
```tsx
// Check serviceKey matches servicesData key
onClick={() => handleLearnMore('correctServiceKey')}

// Verify servicesData object exists
const servicesData = { ... }; // Must be defined before use
```

#### Missing Service Data
```tsx
// Ensure complete service object structure
const serviceExample = {
  title: "Required",
  description: "Required", 
  fullDescription: "Required",
  features: [], // Required array
  benefits: [], // Required array
  caseStudy: {}, // Required object
  pricing: {}, // Required object
  timeline: "Required"
};
```

#### Styling Issues
```tsx
// Maintain theme colors
className="text-[#f97316]" // Correct
className="text-orange-500" // Avoid generic colors

// Preserve existing classes
className="existing-classes" // Keep original styling
```

#### State Management Problems
```tsx
// Proper cleanup on modal close
onClose={() => {
  setShowModal(false);
  setSelectedService(null); // Important: clear selected service
}}
```

## Performance Optimization

### State Management
- Use `useState` for simple modal state
- Clear selected service on modal close
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

### Component Optimization
- ServiceDetailModal only renders when needed
- Lazy loading of modal content
- Efficient icon imports from lucide-react

### Bundle Size
- Reuse existing components where possible
- Minimize new dependencies
- Optimize import statements

## Maintenance Procedures

### Adding New Services
1. **Update servicesData**: Add new service with complete structure
2. **Add Button Handler**: Include onClick with correct serviceKey
3. **Test Functionality**: Verify modal opens with correct data
4. **Update Documentation**: Add service to this guide

### Updating Existing Services
1. **Locate Service Data**: Find in respective page's servicesData
2. **Update Fields**: Modify pricing, features, or case studies
3. **Maintain Structure**: Keep consistent data format
4. **Test Changes**: Verify modal displays updated information

### Service Removal
1. **Remove from servicesData**: Delete service object
2. **Remove Button Handler**: Remove corresponding onClick
3. **Update UI**: Remove service card or section
4. **Clean Documentation**: Update service counts and references
